                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>As a development economist and former academic staff member at Makerere University, I am deeply committed to the practical application of rigorous research in economic development. My expertise lies in blending advanced econometric methods and geospatial data analysis to address critical issues in developing economies. Originally from Uganda and now based in the United States, I have dedicated my career to fostering financial literacy and empowerment, particularly among women, through innovative educational programs and targeted research initiatives. My current research ventures include a fascinating exploration of the relationship between dietary patterns and environmental factors in Uganda. Utilizing sophisticated geospatial mapping tools, I am investigating how variations in the National Vegetation Index correlate with local food choices. This project not only highlights the intersection of geography and nutrition but also serves as a vital tool for developing targeted interventions that can enhance food security and dietary quality in resource-limited settings. In addition to my environmental research, I have pioneered a randomized controlled trial in Eastern Uganda aimed at enhancing financial literacy and aspirations among women micro-entrepreneurs. This project utilizes a gamified digital application to educate women on financial management, coupled with motivational strategies that inspire and elevate their economic roles. The preliminary findings indicate a notable improvement in financial behaviors and empowerment, underscoring the potential of integrated educational technologies in stimulating profound economic and social growth. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have consistently pushed the boundaries of traditional economic research to include multidimensional and interdisciplinary approaches. My work has not only been recognized in academic circles but has also influenced policy discussions and development strategies globally. As I continue to engage with various stakeholders from academic, governmental, and non-governmental organizations, my goal remains to catalyze sustainable development through education, empowerment, and evidence-based policies.</p>
